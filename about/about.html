			<h1>About This Website</h1>
			
			<img src="../images/heart_hands.jpg" alt="Hands forming a heart shape representing care and compassion" style="max-width: 300px; border-radius: 8px; display: block; margin: 1rem auto;">
			
			<p>I created this website because I wanted to give people a place to receive <strong>motivation</strong> when things feel <em>discouraging or hard</em>.</p>
			
			<h2>Why I Made This</h2>
			
			<p>Life isn't always easy. We all go through hard times when we need some encouragement. Sometimes reading the right words can actually make a difference.</p>
			
			<h3>What's Here</h3>
			
			<p>Here's what I included:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Quotes that might brighten your day</li>
				<li>Mental health resources if you need them</li>
				<li>A place to share quotes that help you</li>
				<li>Just a reminder that you're not alone</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Things to Remember</h3>
			
			<p>Some things that are important to remember:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><strong>It's okay to ask for help</strong> - Seriously, it's actually brave</li>
				<li><strong>Small steps count</strong> - You don't have to be perfect</li>
				<li><strong>Your feelings matter</strong> - They're valid</li>
				<li><strong>Things can get better</strong> - Even if it doesn't feel like it right now</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;">I hope something here helps, even a little bit.</p>
