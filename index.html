			<h1>Welcome to Words of Hope</h1>
			
			<p>Life can be <strong>really hard</strong> sometimes, and we all need a little encouragement. I made this website as a place to find <em>motivational quotes</em> and mental health resources when things get tough.</p>
			
			<h2>What's Here</h2>
			
			<p>I put together some stuff that might help when you're having a rough day:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>About:</strong> Why I made this site</li>
				<li><strong>Quotes:</strong> Some quotes that have helped me</li>
				<li><strong>Resources:</strong> Mental health resources if you need help</li>
				<li><strong>Submit:</strong> You can share quotes that help you too</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>You're Not Alone</h3>
			
			<p>It's okay to not be okay. Taking care of your mental health matters just as much as physical health.</p>
			
			<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Feel free to look around and hopefully something here helps.</p>
